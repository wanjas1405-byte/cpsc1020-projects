## COVID Self-Assessment Console Program

This is a C++ console program I wrote for CPSC 1020. 
It asks the user about their COVID test results and exposure, 
then tells them how long they should isolate and when they can return to school. 

Concepts I used:
- Conditional statements and logic
- Taking input from the user and displaying output
- Structuring a program with functions
